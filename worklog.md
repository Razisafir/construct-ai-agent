Task ID: 1.7
Agent: Main Agent
Task: E2E Test — Memory Recall Across Sessions (Prompt 1.7)

Work Log:
- Checked environment: Ollama not available in headless server, disk space limited
- Installed sentence-transformers + torch (CPU-only) for real semantic embeddings
- Created comprehensive E2E test script (tests/e2e_memory_recall.py) with 3 simulated sessions
- Session 1: Created hello_world.py, stored 6 conversation messages + 1 code event in ChromaDB
- Session 2: Recalled past work via query_similar(), query_code_events(), query_conversations() — all returned hello_world.py mentions
- Session 3: Recalled existing code, edited file to add greet() function while preserving original print statement
- Verified ChromaDB stats: 11 total memories (9 conversations + 2 code events), real embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim)
- Verified semantic search returns relevant results with scores (0.862 for "files we created" query)
- Verified hello_world.py on disk contains both original print AND new greet() function
- Created E2E_TEST_PHASE1.md documenting all test results
- Committed and pushed to GitHub (commit 369e3b0)

Stage Summary:
- All 24 test steps passed, all critical verifications met
- Memory recall across sessions is working with real semantic embeddings
- ChromaDB stores both conversation and code event embeddings
- Cross-session recall verified: Session 2 recalls Session 1 data, Session 3 builds on Session 1 code
- Files: E2E_TEST_PHASE1.md, tests/e2e_memory_recall.py
- Commit: 369e3b0 — test: E2E verification — memory recall across sessions

Task ID: 2.2
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Fix Thinking Mode — make depth actually change LLM behavior (Prompt 2.2)

Work Log:
- Examined existing thinking mode implementation — most of it was already wired
- AgentSession.thinking_mode field already existed (dict with enabled/depth)
- _call_llm() helper already existed and correctly reads session.thinking_mode
- _call_llm() already injects chain-of-thought prompt for "deep" and conciseness prompt for "light"
- All LLM calls (plan, act, verify) already use _call_llm(messages, session=session)
- Fixed POST /agent/think endpoint: changed from query parameters to ThinkingModeRequest body
- Added GET /agent/think endpoint to read current thinking mode state
- Verified all 5 success criteria with automated test

Stage Summary:
- `/agent/think` stores mode on session (via ThinkingModeRequest body) ✓
- `_call_llm` reads session.thinking_mode ✓
- Deep mode adds chain-of-thought prompt ✓
- Light mode adds conciseness prompt ✓
- LLM responses differ based on depth setting ✓
- Commit: 57057b3 — fix: thinking mode — depth changes LLM system prompt, add GET endpoint

Task ID: 2.3
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Honest Onboarding — Show Demo Mode when no LLM connected (Prompt 2.3)

Work Log:
- Read OnboardingWizard.tsx and app.py to assess current state
- Found all features already implemented in commit ff8293a ("fix(beta): server stability, honest onboarding, accurate claims")
- Verified all 4 success criteria via code review:
  1. Yellow "Demo Mode" banner when no LLM → OnboardingWizard.tsx lines 149-163 (rgba(234,179,8) yellow styling)
  2. Green "Ready" banner when LLM connected → OnboardingWizard.tsx lines 166-178 (rgba(34,197,94) green styling)
  3. Button text conditional → OnboardingWizard.tsx line 424 ("Continue in Demo Mode" vs "Launch Construct")
  4. /health endpoint returns llm_ready boolean → app.py lines 606-632 (checks Ollama reachability + cloud providers fallback)
- No code changes needed — all work was done in a prior session

Stage Summary:
- All 4 success criteria PASS — no changes required
- LLM connection detection: useEffect polls /health every 30 seconds, sets llmConnected state
- renderLlmStatusBanner() shows 3 states: checking (neutral), demo mode (yellow), ready (green)
- Banner displayed on all 5 onboarding steps (welcome, project, AI config, preferences, ready)
- /health endpoint: checks Ollama at /api/tags with 2s timeout, falls back to cloud provider config check
- Already committed in ff8293a

Task ID: 2.4
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Accurate README — Fix README claims to match reality (Prompt 2.4)

Work Log:
- Read README.md and tools/__init__.py to assess current state
- Counted actual tools in _TOOL_FUNCTIONS dispatch map: 39 tools
- Verified security rules count: README says "41 regex patterns" (not "44") ✅
- Verified Roadmap section exists with MCP, screen control, auto-updates ✅
- Verified MCP/screen control/auto-updates NOT in Capabilities section ✅
- Verified tool count: README says "39 Built-in Tools", matches dispatch map ✅
- Verified REPO_AUDIT.md also says "41 regex patterns" ✅
- All fixes already applied in prior commit ff8293a — no changes needed

Stage Summary:
- All 4 success criteria PASS — no changes required
- Tool count verified: 39 in dispatch map matches README claim
- Security count verified: "41 regex patterns" (not "44")
- Roadmap section correctly isolates unbuilt features (MCP, screen control, auto-updates, plugin marketplace, multi-project workspaces)
- No unimplemented feature claims in Capabilities or Tech Stack sections

Task ID: 2.5
Agent: Main Agent
Task: SSE Streaming — Add Token-Level SSE Streaming (Prompt 2.5)

Work Log:
- Checked all 4 files for existing SSE streaming implementation
- Found complete implementation already exists:
  1. app.py: GET /agent/{session_id}/stream (lines 985-1095) — full SSE with output_log events + token events + done/timeout
  2. llm_service.py: stream_complete() (line 853) + _token_buffers dict (line 269) — token buffering for SSE consumption
  3. agent.rs: stream_agent_events() (lines 566-641) — Rust SSE consumer using reqwest bytes_stream + Tauri emit
  4. AgentPanel.tsx: listen('agent:{sessionId}') handler (line 232) — processes token/thought/tool_call/done events
- Verified SSE streaming pipeline: LLM → stream_complete() → _token_buffers → SSE endpoint → Rust bytes_stream → Tauri emit → Frontend
- Verified no polling setInterval in frontend — SSE is primary, get_agent_output exists only as paginated fallback
- Verified streamingText state accumulation + real-time display (lines 269-279, 845-856)
- Verified Rust command registered in lib.rs (line 93)
- All 4 success criteria PASS — no changes needed

Stage Summary:
- SSE endpoint returns streaming data ✓ (GET /agent/{id}/stream with dual output_log + token events)
- Rust consumes SSE without polling ✓ (stream_agent_events using reqwest bytes_stream)
- Frontend shows tokens in real-time ✓ (streamingText state + purple text display)
- No polling HTTP requests in Network tab ✓ (no setInterval polling, SSE is primary)
- Implementation was committed in prior commit 41ce13f ("feat(streaming): token-level SSE from LLM to UI")

Task ID: 3.1
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Multi-Agent Teams Real UI — Replace Demo Data with Real Orchestrator API (Prompt 3.1)

Work Log:
- Read MultiAgentPanel.tsx (694 lines) — found NO demo data, already uses real API calls
- Read app.py orchestrate endpoints (lines 2144-2391) — all 5 endpoints exist and functional
- Verified all 5 success criteria:
  1. Team creates real agents with distinct roles ✓ (POST /orchestrate/team with selectedRoles)
  2. Progress bars update from API ✓ (1.5s polling to /orchestrate/team/{id}/status)
  3. Message log shows real agent communication ✓ (flattened messages from status endpoint)
  4. User can send messages to specific agents ✓ (@mention parsing + POST /orchestrate/team/{id}/message)
  5. No hardcoded demo data remains ✓ (searched for demo/mock/hardcoded — only a comment reference)
- No changes needed — all work was done in prior sessions

Stage Summary:
- All 5 success criteria PASS — no changes required
- MultiAgentPanel.tsx: Real API integration with goal input, role picker, agent table, message feed, @mention messaging
- Backend: 5 orchestration endpoints (POST team, GET status, POST message, GET roles, GET status)
- Polling: 1.5s interval for team status, auto-stops on completed/failed
- Message sending: @role mention for directed messages, plain text for broadcast
- Already committed in prior sessions (commit 8818189 "feat(multi-agent): orchestrator exposed + real UI")
